_A real picture of me is coming (Credits : [Milo Kalita](https://twitter.com/MiloKalita))..._

Greetings ! I am Ga√©tan "The Aarnold" Jalin, a physicist but also a keen game developer who wants to share his knowledge through blogging.
I am currently working on a Modular Designed, Modern C++ Game Engine, but also computer graphics, shaders and more !

My objective, as I said, is to share my work and knowledge with other people, professionnals or beginners, about game development, and eventually
make my own games.
