Greetings And welcome to The Aarnold Project !

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Ga√©tan "The Aarnold" Jalin, I am a physicist but also a keen programmer, mainly in game development.
This is a nice thing because this is exactly what this blog is about : programming, mainly C++, my favorite language, but also game development in general.

Allow me to introduce you to...

## The Aarnold Project

As I just said before, I will regularly post new articles about programming and game development, but also other things as we'll see below.

But how and why have I decided to start this project ?

## How ?

Thus far, I've been interested for over 7 years about programming and game development. I always wanted to make my own games. Tell a story and bring it to life through
video games was something fabulous for me. So I started to teach myself how to code and make video games. I discovered a platform called [Open Classrooms](https://openclassrooms.com)
which was a really good starting point and allowed me to take my first steps in the (Hello) World of Programming.

I tried many languages for over 2 years, making small unfinished video games prototypes in Java and then in C, until I started learning C++.
C++ is now definitely my favorite language and its regular updates (every 3 years) make it more interesting each time.

At the same time I started to notice the redundancy of certain parts of my programs, so I started making my first "Game Engine" that would encapsulate all these repetitive pieces of code
and would allow me to make almost any game easily. I had no idea how difficult and challenging this would gets.

This Game Engine is now my main project, and it's one of the main reason why I make this blog.

## Why ?

To continue with the story (I'm sure you like it :) ), in 2019, as I was looking for something I don't remember on the Internet, I discovered [Arcadia Corporation](https://www.arcadia-corporation.com/),
a community of French independants game makers, growing around a game platform project of the same name. The Project appeared to be really interesting, so i joined the discord server of the community.

Being able to share with so many people, professionnals and beginners, about game development in a growing community (Currently more than 1000 people !) is something really instructive
and allows you to meet people you woudn't have met otherwise.

This is where I discovered that my game engine project appeared to interest some people eager to learn more about how to make one as an independent developer and all the knowledge and resource it takes.

Here's the main reason why I'm opening this blog today.

Besides, I already thought about opening one in the past, but knowing it would actually interest people is more motivating !

That being said, I will not only speak about game engine development on this blog, I have a lot more to say about programming and game development in general,
as well as shaders development and even physics and mathematics !

## And this is just the beginning...

The Aarnold Project should grow with time and become a place where you may learn useful things about game development. At least, that's my objective.

So stay tuned, the real stuff are coming on !
